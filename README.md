## Get Started!

This will create a remote (private) repository in the class github organization.  Go to your private repo on GitHub in the organization, click the green code button, navigate to "SSH" under Clone, and copy the url.

* Open Rstudio at [https://rstudio.stat.duke.edu](https://rstudio.stat.duke.edu) and login with your netid and password or use your local version of R

* Create a new project by cloning the repo at  `hw#-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME`  (substitute the HW number and your github username).  To create a new Project in RStudio, click on New Project in the file menu. Select Version Control, then Git, then paste the URL from the first step in the Repository URL field, provide a name for the project, e.g. 'hw#', and select a directory to save your work, e.g. HW.

* On the lower right panel in RStudio, click on the Files tab. You should see a listing of the files in your directory. Click on `.Rnw` to open it in the RStudio editor and then follow instructions there.  To create a PDF, use the Compile to PDF icon.
